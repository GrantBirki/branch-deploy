# Examples

This section contains real world and common examples of how you could use this Action

> Note: In all examples, we will be using `uses: github/branch-deploy@vX.X.X`. Replace `X.X.X` with the [latest version](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/branch-deploy) of this Action

## Simple Example

This is the simplest possible example of how you could use the branch-deploy Action for reference

- `.deploy noop` has no effect here (but you could change that)
- `.deploy` will deploy the current branch (you can configure deployments however you like, this is just an example)

```yaml
name: branch-deploy

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

# Permissions needed for reacting and adding comments for IssueOps commands
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  deployments: write
  contents: write
  checks: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request }} # only run on pull request comments

    steps:

        # The branch-deploy Action
      - name: branch-deploy
        id: branch-deploy
        uses: github/branch-deploy@vX.X.X
        
        # If the branch-deploy Action was triggered, checkout our branch
      - uses: actions/checkout@2541b1294d2704b0964813337f33b291d3f8596b # pin@v3.0.2
        with:
          ref: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.ref }}

        # If the branch-deploy Action was triggered, run the deployment (i.e. '.deploy')
      - name: deploy
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop != 'true' }}
        run: <do-your-deployment> # this could be anything you want
```

## Terraform

This example shows how you could use this Action with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

- `.deploy noop` triggers a Terraform plan
- `.deploy` triggers a Terraform apply

All deployment results get posted as a comment in the branch deploy output on your pull request

```yaml

    steps:

      - name: branch-deploy

      - name: Terraform plan
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true' }}
        id: plan
        run: terraform plan -no-color

        # If '.deploy' was used, run a Terraform apply

        id: apply
        run: terraform apply -no-color -auto-approve
        continue-on-error: true # continue on error as we will handle errors later on

        # This step writes the TF plan/apply output to $GITHUB_ENV which the branch-deploy Action will read from and post as a comment on the pull request
      - name: Terraform plan output
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true' }}
        env:

        env:
          TF_STDOUT: ${{ steps.apply.outputs.stdout }}
        run: |
          TF_OUTPUT="\`\`\`terraform\n${TF_STDOUT}\n\`\`\`"
          echo 'DEPLOY_MESSAGE<<EOF' >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "$TF_OUTPUT" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo 'EOF' >> $GITHUB_ENV

        # Here we handle any errors that might have occurred during the Terraform plan/apply and exit accordingly
      - name: Check Terraform plan output
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true' && steps.plan.outcome == 'failure' }}

## SSH

This example shows how you could use this Action with SSH

You can define any commands you want to be run in your SSH Action and they would be gated by the branch-deploy Action.

- `.deploy noop` has no effect here (but you could change that)
- `.deploy` runs the SSH action with your branch
