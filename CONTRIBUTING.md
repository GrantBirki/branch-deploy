### Testing FAQs ðŸ¤”

Answers to questions you might have around testing

Q: Why do I have to commit my changes to `main`?

A: The `on: issue_comment` workflow only uses workflow files from the `main` branch by design - [learn more](https://github.com/GrantBirki/branch-deploy#security-)

Q: Is there an example PR I can view to see how testing with a pull request works?

A: Yes there is! It sure is a messy PR but here is a good [example](https://github.com/GrantBirki/branch-deploy/pull/18)

Q: What workflow is actually running when I do `.deploy` on my testing PR?

A: The workflow that is executing is stored in this repo and can be viewed [here](.github/workflows/test.yml)
