# Branch Deploy Action üöÄ

test

A GitHub Action to enable branch deployments using IssueOps!

This Action does the heavy lifting for you to enable branch deployments:

- üîç Detects when IssueOps commands are used on a pull request
- ‚úèÔ∏è Configurable - Choose your command syntax, environment, noop trigger, base branch, reaction, and more
- ‚úîÔ∏è Respects your branch protection settings configured for the repo
- üó®Ô∏è Comments and reacts to your IssueOps commands
- üöÄ Triggers GitHub deployments for you with zero config

## Turbo Quickstart ‚ö°

Check out a super simple workflow using this Action to quickly get up and running with branch deployments

```yaml
name: "branch deploy demo"

# The workflow to execute on is comments that are newly created
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

# Permissions needed for reacting and adding comments for IssueOps commands
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  deployments: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout your projects repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@3.0.2
  
      # Execute IssueOps branch deployment logic, hooray!
      # This will be used to "gate" all future steps below and conditionally trigger steps/deployments
      - uses: GrantBirki/branch-deploy@vX.X.X
        id: branch-deploy
        with:
          trigger: ".deploy"

      # Run your deployment logic for your project here - examples seen below

      # Do some fake "noop" deployment logic here
      # conditionally run a noop deployment
      - name: fake noop deploy
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true' }}
        run: echo "I am doing a fake noop deploy"

      # Do some fake "regular" deployment logic here
      # conditionally run a regular deployment
      - name: fake regular deploy
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop != 'true' }}
        run: echo "I am doing a fake regular deploy"
```

## About üí°

Before we get into details, let's first define a few key terms below:

- **IssueOps** - Its like ChatOps but instead of using a chat bot, commands are invoked by commenting on a pull request (PRs are issues under the hood) - Example: commenting `.deploy` on a pull request
- **Branch Deployment** - A branch deploy is a deployment methodology that enables you to deploy a branch (or pull request) to a desired environment before merging to `main` or `master` - More on this below
- **PR** - Short for pull request

### IssueOps üó®Ô∏è

The best way to define IssueOps is to compare it to something similar, ChatOps. You may be familiar with the concept ChatOps already but in case you aren't here is a quick definition below:

> ChatOps is the process of interacting with a chat bot to execute commands directly in a chat platform. For example, with ChatOps you might do something like `.ping example.org` to check the status of a website

IssueOps adopts the same mindset but through a different medium. Rather than using a chat service to invoke the commands we use comments on a GitHub Issue or Pull Request. GitHub Actions is the runtime which executes our desired logic

### Branch Deployments üå≤

Branch deployments are a battle tested way of deploying your changes to a given environment for a variety of reasons. Branch deployments allow you to do the following:

- Deploy your changes to production **before** merging
- Deploy changes to a staging, QA, or non-production environment

#### Branch Deployment Core Concepts ‚≠ê

> Note: The `main` branch is considered the base repository branch for all examples below

- The `main` branch is always considered to be a stable and deployable branch
- All changes are deployed to production before they are merged to the `main` branch
- To roll back a branch deployment, you deploy the `main` branch
- `noop` deployments should not make changes but rather report what they "would" have done

#### Why use branch deployments?

> To put the *merge -> deploy* model in the past!

What if your changes are bad and you broke production with the *merge -> deploy* model? Well now you have to revert your PR, get passing CI/builds, and then re-merge your changes to get back to a stable environment. With the **branch deploy** model, this is almost never the case. The `main` branch is considered to be always safe and stable

## How does it work? üìö

> This section will go into detail about how this Action works and hopefully inspire you on ways you can leverage it in your own projects

Let's walk through a GitHub Action workflow using this Action line by line:

```yaml
# The name of the workflow, it can be anything you wish
name: "branch deploy demo"

# The workflow to execute on is comments that are newly created
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

It is important to note that the workflow we want to run IssueOps on is `issue_comment` and `created`. This means we will not run under any other contexts for this workflow. You can edit this as you wish but it does change how this model ultimately works. For example, `issue_comment` workflows **only** use files found on `main` to run. If you do something like `on: pull_request` you could open yourself up to issues as a user could alter a file in a PR and exfil your secrets for example. Only using `issue_comment` is the suggested workflow type

```yaml
# Permissions needed for reacting and adding comments for IssueOps commands
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  deployments: write
  contents: read
```

These are the minimum permissions you need to run this Action

```yaml
jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout your projects repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@3.0.2
```

Sets up your `demo` job, uses an ubuntu runner, and checks out your repo - Just some standard setup for a general Action

```yaml
      # Execute IssueOps branch deployment logic, hooray!
      - uses: GrantBirki/branch-deploy@main
        id: branch-deploy
        with:
          trigger: ".deploy"
```

> Note: It is important to set an `id:` for this job so we can reference its outputs in subsequent steps

The core of this Action takes place here. This block of code will trigger the branch deploy action to run. It will do the following:

1. Check the comment which invoked the workflow for the `trigger:` phrase (`.deploy`) defined here
1. If the trigger phrase is found, it will proceed with a deployment
1. It will start by reacting to your message to let you know it is running
1. The Action will post a comment with a link to the running Actions workflow for you to follow its progress
1. A deployment will be started and attached to your pull request - You'll get a nice little yellow rocket which tells you a deployment is in progress
1. Outputs will be exported by this job for later reference in other jobs as well

```yaml
      # Do some fake "noop" deployment logic here
      # conditionally run a noop deployment
      - name: fake noop deploy
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true' }}
        run: echo "I am doing a fake noop deploy"

      # Do some fake "regular" deployment logic here
      # conditionally run a regular deployment
      - name: fake regular deploy
        if: ${{ steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true' && steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop != 'true' }}
        run: echo "I am doing a fake regular deploy"
```

As seen above, we have two steps. One for a noop deploy, and one for a regular deploy. For example, the noop deploy could trigger a `terraform plan` and the regular deploy could be a `terraform apply`. These steps are conditionally gated by two variables:

- `steps.branch-deploy.outputs.continue == 'true'` - The `continue` variable is only set to true when a deployment should continue
- `steps.branch-deploy.outputs.noop == 'true'` - The `noop` variable is only set to true when a noop deployment should be run

> Example: You comment `.deploy noop` on a pull request. A noop deployment is detected so this action outputs the `noop` variable to `true`. You also have the correct permissions to execute the IssueOps command so the action also outputs the `continue` variable to `true`. This will allow the "fake noop deploy" step seen above to run and the "fake regular deploy" step will be skipped
